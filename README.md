# What is Microsoft Rewards Auto Searcher?
Microsoft Rewards Auto Searcher is an extremely simple and open-source Visual Basic Script that automatically searches 34 randomly generated URLs at random intervals. This process is equivalent to earning 170 Microsoft Rewards points for level 2 users.

# What should I be aware of?
To use this script correctly, it is required to have Microsoft Edge set as your default browser. If the script opens a browser other than Microsoft Edge, you will not receive the 170 Microsoft Rewards points. It's important to note that using automated software to gain points on Microsoft Rewards goes against their Terms of Service. I am not responsible for how you use this script or any modifications you make to it.

# How to use:
To use the Microsoft Rewards Auto Searcher, simply download the file named MicrosoftRewardsAS.vbs and open it. The entire process is automatic and typically takes around 3-5 minutes to complete.
