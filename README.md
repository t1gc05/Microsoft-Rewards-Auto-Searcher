# What is Microsoft-Rewards-Auto-Searcher?
Microsoft Rewards Auto Searcher is an extremely simple and open source Visual Basic Script that automatically searches 34 randomly generated URLs at randomly timed intervals, which is equivalent to 170 Microsoft Rewards points for level 2 users.

# What should I be aware of?
It is required to have Microsoft Edge as your default browser for this script to function correctly, if the script opens another browser that's not Microsoft Edge then you will not be credited the 170 Microsoft Rewards points. Using an automatic software to gain points on Microsoft Rewards is against their Terms Of Service, I am not responsible on how you use this script or how you modify it.

# How to use
Simply download MicrosoftRewardsAS.vbs and open the file, the whole process afterwards is automatic and only takes around 3-5 minutes to complete.
